        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Hi, my name is Nai-Yen Lin, I was born in Taiwan and moved to Canada at 2010. I used to be an ECE student in Western University, but I ended up as a radio host for eight years in Ontario. 
            I used to work as IT analyst in a Tourism agency for about a year, and I found out that the lack of fundamental skills and professional knowledge stops my progression. I went back to Taiwan 
            to serve my military service at 2020.</p>
        
        <p>I came to Vancouver last December and worked in a restaurant for couple months and decided to apply to this program for learning the basics of programming. My career goal is to work as a 
            software developer, more specifically, a back-end or full stack developer. Maintain the grade and apply for co-op will be the fundamental of my strategy. Thank you for teaching!</p>
